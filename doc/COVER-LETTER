    The final public release of the "ISO Development Environment" will be
    available on June 19th 1992.  This release is called

				   ISODE-8.0

    This software supports the development of certain kinds of OSI protocols
    and applications.  Here are the details: 

  - The ISODE is not proprietary, but it is not in the public domain.  This was
    necessary to include a "hold harmless" clause in the release.  The upshot
    of all this is that anyone can get a copy of the release and do anything
    they want with it, but no one takes any responsibility whatsoever for any
    (mis)use.

  - The ISODE runs on native Berkeley and AT&T System V systems
    in addition to various other UNIX-like operating systems.  No kernel
    modifications are required.

  - The modules include:
	OSI transport service (TP0 on top of TCP, X.25 and CONS; TP4
	    for SunLink OSI)
	OSI session, presentation, and association control services
	ASN.1 abstract syntax/transfer notation tools, including:
	    remote operations stub-generator (front-end for remote operations)
	    structure-generator (ASN.1 to C)
	    element-parser (basic encoding rules)
	OSI reliable transfer and remote operations services
	OSI directory services
	OSI file transfer, access and management
	FTAM/FTP gateway
	OSI virtual terminal (basic class, TELNET profile)

  - ISODE Final consists of final "IS" level implementations with the
    exception of VT which is a DIS implementation.  The ISODE also 
    contains implementations of the 1984 X.400 versions of ROS and RTS.

  - The discussion group ISODE@NISC.SRI.COM is used as an open forum on ISODE.
    Contact ISODE-Request@NISC.SRI.COM to be added to this list.

  - The primary documentation for this release consists of an update to the
    ISODE 7.0 manual.  The ISODE 7.0 manual consists of a five volume
    User's Manual (approx. 1000 pages) and a set of UNIX manual pages.  The
    sources to the User's Manual are in LaTeX format.  In addition, there are
    a number of notes, papers, and presentations included in the documentation
    set, again in either LaTeX or SLiTeX format.  





    DISTRIBUTION SITES

    The FTP or FTAM distributions of ISODE-8.0 consists of 3 files.  
    The source code and update documentation for the ISODE-8.0
    distribution is in the file isode-8.tar.Z which is
    approximately 5.5MB in size. 

    LaTeX source for the entire document set can be found
    in the isode-7-doc.tar.Z file (3.5MB).  A list of documents can be
    found in the doc/ directory of the source tree.

    A Postscript version of the five volume manual can be found in the
    isode-7-ps.tar.Z file (4.3MB), and the update document in the
    isode-8.ps.Z file (120KB).


 1. FTP
    If you can FTP to the Internet, then use anonymous FTP to uu.psi.com
    [136.161.128.3] to retrieve the files in BINARY mode from the
    isode/ directory. 

 2. NIFTP
    If you run NIFTP over the public X.25 or over JANET, and are registered in
    the NRS at Salford, you can use NIFTP with username "guest" and your own
    name as password, to access UK.AC.UCL.CS to retrieve the files
    from the <SRC> directory

 3. FTAM on the JANET, IXI or PSS
    The sources are available by FTAM from UCL over X.25 using 
	JANET (DTE 00000511160013), 
	IXI   (DTE 20433450420113) or 
	PSS   (DTE 23421920030013) 
    all with TSEL "259" (ASCII encoding).  
    (This service is registered under "ucl, gb" in the OSI Directory).
    Use the "anon" user-identity and retrieve the files from the 
    src/ directory. 
    The file service is provided by the FTAM implementation in
    ISODE 6.0 or later (IS FTAM). 



    ISODE CONSORTIUM

    The ISODE Consortium is a not-for-profit cooperative enterprise, whose
    mission is to promote and develop the ISODE package of OSI (Open
    System Interconnection) applications, which has been used extensively
    in the research community.  The ISODE Consortium will be able to
    evolve the ISODE software more rapidly than would be possible for any
    single member.  This will be to the mutual benefit of members of the
    consortium, and will help to stimulate the market for OSI, which
    is key technology to enable open communication between and within
    organisations.  Membership of the ISODE Consortium is open to any
    organisation in any country.

    The ISODE Consortium releases of ISODE will be made exclusively
    available to the ISODE Consortium members or by purchase of products
    from ISODE Consortium members.  Academic organisations, and not for
    profit or government organisations with research as their primary
    purpose, will be given zero cost access to the ISODE Consortium
    releases, on the basis of simply signing a licence with minimal
    administrative overhead.  This builds on a major strength of the
    ISODE package by facilitating use of ISODE within the research
    community, whilst allowing ISODE to evolve as a product base.

    The ISODE Consortium has mailing lists for bug reports relating to the
    ISODE Package.   These are:

   	<bug-quipu@isode.com>   -- bugs relating to QUIPU
	<bug-pp@isode.com>      -- bugs relating to PP
	<bug-isode@isode.com>   -- bugs relating to any other parts of ISODE

    These lists are for the planned ISODE Consortium releases of ISODE.  
    Bug reports relating to the "ISODE-8.0" release of ISODE are
    welcome.   Changes will be incorporated into the ISODE Consortium
    releases, and not released to the public domain.
