# Notice, Disclaimer, and Conditions of Use

(This license was copied from _The ISO Development Environment: User's Manual,
Volume 1: Application Services_ (which is included in this repo) by
Jonathan M. Wilbur, after formatting as Markdown and correcting a small typo. In
the opinion of Jonathan M. Wilbur, this license is basically identical to the
MIT license, but different only because the MIT license was very newly created
when ISODE was created. I am not a lawyer. What follows is the original text of
the license as described above.)
